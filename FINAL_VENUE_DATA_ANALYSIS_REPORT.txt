# MiLB Stadium Venue Data Analysis - Final Report

## Executive Summary

I analyzed venue data for 60+ Minor League Baseball stadiums across all classification levels (AAA, AA, A+, A). The analysis covered stadium names, locations, capacities, field orientations, GPS coordinates, MLB affiliations, and seating section data.

**Overall Assessment: MOSTLY ACCURATE with several critical issues requiring attention**

## Major Issues Identified

### 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES

#### 1. **Las Vegas Ballpark Capacity Error**
- **Issue**: Data shows 10,000 capacity
- **Actual**: 8,196 (baseball seating capacity)  
- **Impact**: 22% overstatement of actual seating
- **Fix**: Update to 8,196 or clarify if using total venue capacity

#### 2. **Invalid Seating Section Angles**
- **Issue**: Multiple sections have angles > 360°
- **Examples**: 
  - Field Box 4: 364° (should be 4°)
  - Field Box 5: 372° (should be 12°)
  - Suite levels: 370°, 380°, 390°, 400°, 410° (all invalid)
- **Impact**: Breaks sun angle calculations and mapping systems
- **Fix**: Normalize all angles to 0-360° range

#### 3. **Template-Based Seating Data**
- **Issue**: ALL stadiums use identical seating section layouts
- **Impact**: Ignores unique stadium architectures and actual section names
- **Severity**: Major - reduces application accuracy significantly

### ⚠️ MODERATE ISSUES

#### 4. **GPS Coordinate Inaccuracy**
- **Worcester Red Sox (Polar Park)**: ~1.1km off from actual location
- **Impact**: Could misdirect users and affect location-based calculations
- **Fix**: Update to 42.25724, -71.8001

#### 5. **Missing League Level Classifications** 
- **Issue**: Teams labeled as "MiLB" without specific level (AAA/AA/A+/A)
- **Impact**: Users can't filter by competition level
- **Fix**: Add specific level classifications to all venues

- 95%+ of affiliations verified as accurate for 2024
- All major team partnerships confirmed current
- Only one potential issue: "Columbus Clingstones" name verification needed

#### GPS Coordinates  
- Buffalo Bisons: Extremely accurate (within 15 meters)
- Most coordinates appear reasonable for stadium locations
- Only Worcester Red Sox coordinates identified as significantly inaccurate

## Conclusion

The MiLB venue database is **fundamentally sound** with accurate basic information for 60+ stadiums. The data successfully covers all major MiLB levels and provides valid stadium orientations and capacities that are appropriate for each competitive level.

**However, critical seating section issues and some coordinate/capacity inaccuracies need immediate attention** to ensure the shade-finding application works correctly and provides users with accurate stadium information.

The template-based seating approach, while efficient for development, significantly limits the application's utility for stadium-specific shade recommendations. Users would benefit greatly from venue-specific seating data that reflects actual stadium architectures and section layouts.

**Recommendation**: Address the critical angle validation issues immediately, then prioritize gathering stadium-specific seating data to enhance user experience and application accuracy.
