# theshadium.com — Sun/Shade Accuracy Audit (2026-08-07)

## Verdict

**The site tells users to sit on the sunny side.** Three of the four production
shade models have the sun/shade sides **exactly inverted**. All 900 existing
tests pass, because no test ever compared model output against the physical rule
using realistic section data.

## Ground truth (the rule everything must obey)

A grandstand shades its own seats. The stands on the **same compass side as the
sun** are in their own shadow (**shaded**); the stands **across the bowl from the
sun** take the light in the face (**sunny**).

This is not my invention — it is the convention already documented in
`src/utils/sectionSunCalculations.ts` (header), used by `src/utils/shadeSide.ts`
and `app/stadium/[stadiumId]/StadiumPageSSR.tsx`, and confirmed by the sourced
sun-pattern notes already sitting in `src/data/stadiums.ts`:

- Rogers Centre (orientation 0°/N): *"3rd base side is the shade side, 1st base
  side is sunny."* 3B compass = 270° (W) = where the afternoon sun is. ✔
- Guaranteed Rate / Progressive / Busch notes all read *"3B shade side"* for
  parks whose 3B side faces west. ✔
- Matches Wrigley (3B shaded, 1B bakes), Fenway (3B grandstand shaded, CF/RF
  bleachers roast), Oracle Park (1B side shaded in the afternoon).

## Measured evidence

Probe: all 30 MLB parks × 1 PM / 4 PM / 7 PM on 2025-07-15 (87 daylight samples).
For each, compare the section whose compass bearing equals the sun azimuth
(**must be shadier**) against the section 180° opposite (**must be sunnier**).

| # | Model | File | Powers | Correct |
|---|-------|------|--------|---------|
| A | `getSectionSunExposure` | `src/utils/sectionSunCalculations.ts` | stadium-page shade diagram | **30/87** |
| B | `SunCalculator` *as UnifiedApp calls it* | `src/utils/sunCalculator.ts` | homepage MLB section list, MobileApp | **31/87** |
| B′ | `SunCalculator` given correct compass angles | " | " | **1/87** |
| C | `calculateRowShadows`, rows **with** overhang | `src/utils/sunCalculator.ts` | `/api/stadium/*/rows/shade` | **0/87** |
| C | `calculateRowShadows`, rows without overhang | " | " | 29/87 |
| D | `getUnifiedVenueShade` | `src/utils/getUnifiedVenueShade.ts` | homepage shade % + "most shaded first" sort, **all 180+ venues** | **0/87** |

B and B′ differ because UnifiedApp/MobileApp also pass the wrong angle — the two
bugs partially cancel into noise. A scores 30/87 because it is directionally
right but goes flat at high sun (see H-1); it never actually points the wrong way.

## Root cause

There is no single tested primitive for "which side of the bowl is in shade."
Four independent implementations each re-derived it from scratch; three inverted
the sign. Comments in `sunCalculator.ts` and `getUnifiedVenueShade.ts` even
*mislabel* the branches ("Section faces away from sun" on the branch where the
seats face into the sun), which is how the inversion survived review.

The test suite locked in the defect rather than catching it:
`src/utils/__tests__/shadeSanity.test.ts` asserts the correct physical ordering,
but only for sections built with `overhangHeight: 0` — a configuration that does
not exist in the real data (6,877 of 30,551 real MLB rows carry an overhang). On
those synthetic sections model C is right; on every real section it is inverted.

## Todo

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE. The shared geometry primitive now powers all four
production paths; the all-park direction probe, full test suite, strict data
audit, type-check, lint, production build, and rendered browser checks pass.

### Phase 1 — one source of truth
- [x] 1.1 Add `src/utils/bowlGeometry.ts`: the single documented primitive —
      `sectionCompassAngle()` (moved from `sectionSunCalculations`) plus
      `sunIncidence(sunAz, sectionCompass) → { sunBehindFactor, sunFacingFactor }`,
      continuous, no branch at 90°, with the physics derivation in the header.
- [x] 1.2 Add `src/utils/__tests__/bowlGeometry.test.ts` — sign, continuity,
      symmetry, wrap-around.

### Phase 2 — fix the three inverted models (user-facing, highest impact)
- [x] 2.1 `getUnifiedVenueShade.ts`: swap the inverted branches, rebuild on the
      Phase-1 primitive. (Homepage shade % for every venue.)
- [x] 2.2 `sunCalculator.ts#calculateSectionShadow`: swap the inverted branch;
      delete the false "angles are already absolute compass" comment on
      `getSectionAngle`.
- [x] 2.3 `UnifiedApp.tsx:224` + `MobileApp.tsx:193`: stop passing raw
      stadium-local `baseAngle` as a compass `angle`; use `sectionCompassAngle`.
      Also fix the two different, both-wrong `side` derivations.
- [x] 2.4 `sunCalculator.ts#calculateRowShadows`: swap which regime the overhang
      term belongs to — the deep shade case is *sun behind the section*; the
      *sun-in-your-face* case is back-rows-only under the lip. Keep the
      continuous blend (no 90° discontinuity).

### Phase 3 — the model that points the right way but says nothing
- [x] 3.1 `sectionSunCalculations.ts#getSectionSunExposure`: azimuth
      discrimination currently vanishes at sun altitude ≥ 45°, so at 1 PM and
      4 PM the stadium-page diagram is orientation-blind — every open section
      reads identical. Rebuild on the Phase-1 primitive so azimuth still
      separates sides at high sun, damped but non-zero.
- [x] 3.2 Remove the discontinuity at exactly 90° (adjacent sections currently
      jump ~3× across an invisible seam).

### Phase 4 — row-level data degeneracy
- [x] 4.1 `calculateRowShadows` divides by `Math.max(row.depth, 0.001)`. 647 real
      rows have an overhang and `depth: 0`, so they are pinned to 100% coverage
      whatever the sun does. Treat missing depth as unknown and fall back to the
      section-level answer instead of fabricating full shade.
- [x] 4.2 Audit the 2,310 rows with `depth: 0` — they are valid front-row
      offsets, not missing data. Derive distance behind the overhang lip from
      the section's row set and fall back to section geometry when no positive
      deck depth exists.

### Phase 5 — 3D path (public API `?use3d=true`)
- [x] 5.1 `shadeCalculation3DOptimized.ts#getSunRayDirection` returns the
      direction light *travels* (downward). The occlusion ray is cast from the
      seat along it, i.e. into the ground — a roof above a seat can never
      occlude. Negate it (cast toward the sun).
- [x] 5.2 `estimateSectionShadeQuick`: mixes stadium-local `baseAngle` with
      `sunAz − orientation`, never wraps `angleDiff` to [0,180], and inverts the
      branch. Rebuild on the Phase-1 primitive.

### Phase 6 — unsourced fudge factors
- [x] 6.1 `getUnifiedVenueShade` stacks additive bonuses on top of the physical
      term: upper deck +25/+30, `opened > 2000` +5, retractable +15, and a
      "third base side" +15 applied at **every** park regardless of orientation.
      These can move a section two tiers on no evidence. Remove or ground them.
- [x] 6.2 Weather multiplier conflates UV intensity with geometric shade —
      clouds do not move the shadow line. Separate the two concepts.

### Phase 7 — tests that would have caught this
- [x] 7.1 Replace the synthetic `overhangHeight: 0` sanity sections with **real**
      sections from `getStadiumSections`, all 30 parks × 1 PM/4 PM/7 PM,
      asserting sun-side-shadier for every production entry point.
- [x] 7.2 Pin the published sun-pattern claims from `stadiums.ts` (Rogers Centre
      3B-shade, Chase Field sunrise-over-RF, etc.) as regression tests.
- [x] 7.3 Cross-model consistency test: all four paths must agree on which half
      of the bowl is shaded, for every park and hour.
- [x] 7.4 Re-run the probe; require 87/87 on every model before calling it done.

### Phase 8 — verify
- [x] 8.1 Full `npx jest` green.
- [x] 8.2 `npm run type-check` + `npm run lint` clean (lint has pre-existing
      warnings, zero errors).
- [x] 8.3 Spot-check the rendered site (homepage + Rate Field, Fenway Park,
      and Oracle Park) against the
      published shade guidance for those parks.

## Review

### What changed

- Added `bowlGeometry.ts` as the one coordinate/physics source for compass
  conversion, continuous sun incidence, shadow reach, rim occlusion, structural
  shade, and direct-sun percentage.
- Refit the homepage, mobile, venue diagram, row API, and optimized 3D paths to
  that primitive. Stadium orientation is no longer discarded by passing a
  local `baseAngle` as an absolute compass angle.
- Corrected the 3D ray direction and coordinate frame, normalized obstruction
  bounding boxes, and combined ray-cast obstructions with the bowl's own
  structural self-shading.
- Replaced invented venue bonuses with geometry and separated geometric shade
  from weather-damped effective sunlight.
- Added all-park, real-production-data direction tests, published-guidance
  regressions, cross-model agreement checks, and route-level sign coverage.

### Verification

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm test -- --runInBand` | ✅ 954 / 954, 30 suites |
| Row shade route integration | ✅ 9 / 9 |
| `npm run type-check` | ✅ exit 0 |
| `npm run lint` | ✅ exit 0; existing warnings only |
| `npm run validate-stadium-data` | ✅ no hard data errors |
| `npm run build` | ✅ 460 static pages generated |
| Browser smoke check | ✅ homepage + 3 MLB venue pages; no console errors |

### Remaining data-fidelity limitation

The direction and coordinate fixes are complete, but the underlying section
map is still approximate at 27 of 30 MLB parks. Only Yankee Stadium, Fenway
Park, and Rate Field currently carry real per-section geometry. The UI already
discloses this on approximate parks (confirmed at Oracle Park), and the strict
audit reports all 27 plus five duplicate-template pairs. Replacing those maps
requires sourced seating/overhang survey data; inventing it would make the
accuracy problem worse, not better.
