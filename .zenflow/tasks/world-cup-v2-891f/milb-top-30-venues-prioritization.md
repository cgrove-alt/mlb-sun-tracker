## Risk Mitigation

### Data Availability Challenges
- **Risk:** Some stadiums may have limited public seating data
- **Mitigation:** Prioritize venues with detailed interactive seating charts; use multiple data sources; reach out to teams for architectural plans if needed

### Resource Constraints
- **Risk:** 150-210 hours of data collection is substantial
- **Mitigation:** Phased approach allows validation of methodology; can adjust timeline or scope based on learnings from Tier 1

### Data Maintenance
- **Risk:** MiLB stadiums may undergo renovations or seating changes
- **Mitigation:** Implement data freshness tracking system; prioritize newer stadiums (less likely to change); establish annual review process

### Market Changes
- **Risk:** Team relocations or MLB affiliate changes
- **Mitigation:** Focus on stadium data (independent of team); maintain flexibility to adjust priorities; monitor MiLB announcements

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1 - Tier 1)

1. **Begin with Lehigh Valley IronPigs** (#1 overall) - Set quality benchmark
2. **Follow with Dayton Dragons** - Validate High-A methodology
3. **Complete Sacramento, Charlotte, Nashville** - Top Triple-A markets
4. **Finish Tier 1 with Durham, Toledo, Indianapolis, Las Vegas** - Round out top 10

### Quality Over Speed
- Maintain 60+ section standard established in MLB Phase 1
- Use proven 5-7 hour per stadium methodology
- Implement validation at each step to prevent technical debt
- Build institutional knowledge for remaining 90 MiLB venues

### Future Expansion Path
- After Top 30: Target specific leagues (e.g., all Pacific Coast League)
- Consider user demand signals from analytics
- Evaluate partnership opportunities with MiLB teams
- Potential premium feature: "Complete MiLB Coverage" for all 120 teams
