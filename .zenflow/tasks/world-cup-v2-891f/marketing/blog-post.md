## Why Shade Matters at World Cup 2026

### 1. **Summer Heat Across Three Countries**

The 2026 World Cup takes place during peak summer:
- **USA venues**: Temperatures ranging from 85-105°F (29-40°C)
- **Mexico venues**: High altitude + intense sun = extreme UV exposure
- **Canada venues**: Milder but still 70-80°F (21-27°C)

### 2. **Match Times and Sun Exposure**

Most matches will be scheduled during afternoon and early evening slots (2:00 PM - 6:00 PM local time) to accommodate global broadcast audiences. This means peak sun exposure for many games.

### 3. **Health and Safety**

Direct sun exposure for 2+ hours can lead to:
- Dehydration and heat exhaustion
- Sunburn and UV damage
- Reduced focus and enjoyment
- Risk of heat stroke in extreme conditions
