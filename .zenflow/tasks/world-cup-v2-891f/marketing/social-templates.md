### Template 2: Quick Tips (Series)
```
🌞 WORLD CUP SHADE TIP #1

Afternoon matches (2-5 PM) = PEAK SUN ☀️

At open-air stadiums, west-side upper decks offer best afternoon shade.

Pro tip: Check TheShadium's countdown timer for EXACT sun position at kickoff.

#WorldCup2026 #TheShadium

```

```
🌞 WORLD CUP SHADE TIP #2

High altitude = HIGH UV exposure ⛰️☀️

Mexico City's Estadio Azteca sits at 7,200 feet.

Even in the shade, you'll need:
✅ SPF 50+ sunscreen
✅ Extra hydration
✅ Wide-brimmed hat

Don't underestimate altitude!

#WorldCup2026
```

```
🌞 WORLD CUP SHADE TIP #3

Retractable roof stadiums (AT&T, NRG, Mercedes-Benz) are LIKELY to be CLOSED for summer heat.

But don't assume! Check with venue before match day.

Our tool adjusts shade maps for open/closed roof scenarios.

🌞 SHADE STRATEGY 101: WORLD CUP EDITION 🌞

Did you know that afternoon matches (2-5 PM) put you at PEAK sun exposure? ☀️

Here's what you need to know:

🏟️ OPEN-AIR STADIUMS
Best bet: Upper deck, west side
Why: Gets shade as sun moves west in afternoon/evening

🏛️ RETRACTABLE ROOF STADIUMS
(AT&T, NRG, Mercedes-Benz, BC Place)
Likely to be CLOSED for summer heat
But check with venue before match day!

⛰️ HIGH ALTITUDE VENUES
(Estadio Azteca, Estadio Akron)
Extra UV exposure even in shade
Pack: SPF 50+, hydration, hat

🔥 HOT & HUMID VENUES
(Miami, Houston, Atlanta)
Seek covered/shaded sections
Hydration is CRITICAL

🏆 Announcing: TheShadium's FIFA World Cup 2026 Shade Finder 🏆

As the largest World Cup in history approaches (48 teams, 104 matches, 16 venues), we've built the most comprehensive stadium shade guide for fans attending matches across North America.

Our platform now features:

📊 Row-level sun exposure analysis for all 16 venues
🌍 Real-time solar calculations accounting for date, time, and location
🗺️ Interactive venue comparison tool
📅 Complete match schedule with countdown timers
🎯 Smart section recommendations based on climate zones

Why it matters:
With matches scheduled during peak summer heat (June-July), many games will face temperatures of 85-105°F. Shade isn't just about comfort—it's about health and safety for the estimated 5+ million fans expected to attend.

The technical challenge:
- Modeling 3D stadium geometries for 16 diverse venues
- Calculating shadow patterns for specific dates/times
- Accounting for retractable roofs, partial canopies, and obstructions
- Serving real-time calculations at scale

Built with: Next.js, TypeScript, 3D solar geometry, and extensive venue research.
