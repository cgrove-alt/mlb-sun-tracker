## Data Collection Strategy

### Approach
Given the capacity (11,026 seats) and multi-level spring training design:

1. **Programmatic Generation** (Recommended)
   - Use algorithmic generation based on documented section ranges
   - 6 main seating tiers (Field Boxes, Dugout Club, 100-Level, 200-Level, Loge, Premium)
   - Smallest MLB capacity for 2025 - manageable scope
   - Validate against total capacity

2. **Section Grouping**
   - Field Boxes (A-S): ~19 sections → ~1,500 seats (79 avg/section)
   - Dugout Club (1-12): 12 sections → 104 seats (8.7 avg/section)
   - 100-Level (102-120): 19 sections → ~5,500 seats (289 avg/section)
   - 200-Level (203-219): 17 sections → ~2,500 seats (147 avg/section)
   - Loge Boxes (1-8): 8 boxes → ~150 seats (19 avg/box)
   - Premium/Club: Various → ~800 seats
   - Outfield: Various → ~500 seats
   - Suites (13): 13 suites → ~270 seats (21 avg/suite)
   - **Total**: ~75+ seating areas

3. **Known Section Ranges**
   - Field Boxes: A-S
   - Dugout Club: 1-12
   - 100-Level: 102-120
   - 200-Level: 203-219
   - Loge Boxes: 1-8

### Validation Targets
- ✅ Total capacity: 11,026 seats (exact match required)
- ✅ Smallest MLB stadium for 2025
- ✅ Spring training design with single-deck configuration
- ✅ ~75+ seating areas
- ✅ Dugout Club: exactly 104 seats

## Estimated Data Collection Time

**Programmatic Generation Approach**:
- Research & planning: 60 minutes ✅ (Complete)
- Script development: 45-60 minutes (estimated, smaller stadium)
- Validation: 45-60 minutes (iterative tuning for exact capacity)
- Pre-computation: 2-3 minutes (11,026 seats - smallest MLB)
- **Total**: ~2.5-3 hours

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Research Complete
2. Create generation script (`scripts/generateRaysSeats.ts`)
3. Generate seat coordinates for ~75 seating areas
4. Validate total capacity matches 11,026 exactly (±0 seats tolerance)
5. Pre-compute sun exposure data for 2026 home games
6. Build and test integration
7. Commit Stadium 24/30 completion (80.0% progress)

## Special Considerations

**Sun Exposure Notes**:
- 316° orientation (NW) means:
  - Morning games: sun from east (third base side exposed)
  - Afternoon games: sun from south/southwest (first base side most exposed)
  - Setting sun affects first base side significantly
  - Best shade: 200-level back rows, loge boxes with overhang
  - Worst sun: 100-level first base side, right field areas
- Open roof: full sun exposure on clear days
- Florida climate: Hot and humid, sun protection critical
- Sun precomputation critical for all seating areas

**Open Roof Considerations**:
- March-May: Warm to hot, 75-90°F, high humidity
- No roof protection from sun or rain
- Traditional outdoor spring training experience
- Rain delays possible

**Eastern Timezone**:
- America/New_York (Eastern Time)
- Observes Daylight Saving Time (UTC-5 winter, UTC-4 summer)
- Same timezone as other Florida teams (Marlins)
- Note: Rays' regular home (Tropicana Field) also Eastern Time

**Validation Priorities**:
- Target exact capacity (11,026 seats)
- Verify Dugout Club = exactly 104 seats
- Verify ~75 seating areas distributed properly
- Account for 13 luxury suites in totals
- Single-deck spring training configuration
- Total = exactly 11,026 seats (100.00% match)

**Obstructions**:
- Check if exists: src/data/obstructions/mlb/rays-obstructions.ts
- May need to create obstruction definitions
- Spring training facility has minimal obstructions
- Scalloped facade may create some shadows
- Ready for sun precomputation after creation

---

**Status**: Ready for generation script development
**Target Capacity**: 11,026 seats (exact match required)
**Target Accuracy**: ±0 seats (100.00%)
**Estimated Sections**: ~75 seating areas
**Generation Method**: Programmatic (recommended)
**Stadium**: 24/30 in completion sequence (80.0% after completion)
