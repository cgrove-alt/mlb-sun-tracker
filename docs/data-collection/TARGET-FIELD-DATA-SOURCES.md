## Stadium Overview

Target Field is an open-air ballpark in downtown Minneapolis, designed with roughly the same number of seats as Fenway Park. The stadium sits on just 8 acres, hemmed in by railroads, a freeway (I-394), and city streets, making space management critical to the design. The modest capacity reflected budget realities and urban constraints.

**Key Features**:
- Open-air design (no retractable roof - would have added $100 million to budget)
- Oriented due north (0°) to minimize sun glare
- Limestone exterior reflecting Minnesota's building traditions
- Record attendance: 45,000+ for P!nk concert (August 10, 2023)
- Designed to replicate classic ballpark feel similar to Fenway Park

- **Official capacity**: 38,544 seats (baseball configuration, 2019-present)
- **Target for generation**: **38,544 seats** (matches stadiums.ts authoritative source)

### Row Count Variations
- **Field Level**: 1-15 rows (varies significantly by section)
- **100-Level**: 1-28 rows (depends on location: corner vs center vs end)
- **200-Level**: 1-8 rows (most compact level)

- **Maximum**: 36 seats (Row 22, Section F - letter section)
- **Average**: ~20 seats per row (typical across all levels)

## Generation Strategy

### Section Organization
1. **Generate Field Level (1-17)**: 17 sections × ~12 rows × ~18 seats = ~3,672 seats
2. **Generate 100-Level (101-140)**: 40 sections × ~20 rows × ~20 seats = ~16,000 seats
3. **Generate 200-Level (201-230)**: 30 sections × ~6 rows × ~16 seats = ~2,880 seats
4. **Generate 300-Level (301-330, skip 328)**: 29 sections × ~12 rows × ~22 seats = ~7,656 seats
5. **Generate Legends Club (A-R)**: 18 sections × ~8 rows × ~14 seats = ~2,016 seats

**Initial Estimate**: ~32,224 seats (83.6% of target)

### Parameter Tuning Strategy
After initial generation, adjust:
1. Increase seats per row for 100-Level (main capacity driver)
2. Adjust row counts for corner sections
3. Fine-tune 300-Level sections
4. Use FINE_TUNE_ADJUSTMENTS for final precision

**Target**: Exactly **38,544 seats** (100.00% accuracy, ±0 seats)
