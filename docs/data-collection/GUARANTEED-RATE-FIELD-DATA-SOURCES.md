## Notes on Data Collection

### Section Gaps & Special Cases
- **200-Level (206-254)**: Primarily luxury suites, not standard seating sections
- **400-Level (406-459)**: Mix of luxury boxes and premium seating
- Some section numbers may be reserved for suites/boxes only
- Total "section" count (~307) includes suites which won't be generated as regular seating

### Capacity Reconciliation
- **MapaPlan.com**: Shows 45,080 total (likely includes all configurations, standing room, suites)
- **Wikipedia**: 40,615 seats (baseball configuration, 2004-present) ✅
- **Official MLB**: 40,615 seats (confirms Wikipedia)
- **Target for generation**: **40,615 seats** (matches stadiums.ts authoritative source)

### Generation Strategy Notes
- **Suites (200/400 levels)**: Generate simplified suite seating or consolidate
- **Scout Seats**: Include as premium 100-level home plate sections
- **Bleachers (160-164)**: Standard bench-style seating
- **500-Level**: Reduced from original 29 rows to 21 rows (post-2004)
- **Club Level (300)**: 1,822 seats exactly documented

## Generation Strategy

### Section Organization
1. **Generate 100-Level (101-164)**: 64 sections × ~17 rows × ~18 seats = ~19,584 seats
2. **Generate 200-Level (Suites) (206-254)**: Simplified ~49 suites × ~6-8 seats = ~350-400 seats per suite (estimate ~2,000 total for suite capacity)
3. **Generate 300-Level (Club) (311-357)**: Target 1,822 seats exactly
   - 47 sections × ~8 rows × ~5 seats (varies) = ~1,822 seats
4. **Generate 400-Level (Luxury) (406-459)**: ~54 sections × ~8 rows × ~6 seats = ~2,592 seats
5. **Generate 500-Level (506-558)**: 53 sections × ~15 rows × ~20 seats = ~15,900 seats

**Initial Estimate**: ~42,698 seats (needs tuning down by ~2,083 to hit 40,615)

### Parameter Tuning Strategy
After initial generation, adjust:
1. Reduce seats per row across levels
2. Adjust row counts (especially 500-level where 8 rows were removed)
3. Account for wheelchair accessible seats (400 seats distributed)
4. Fine-tune with FINE_TUNE_ADJUSTMENTS for final precision

**Target**: Exactly **40,615 seats** (100.00% accuracy, ±0 seats)
