### Summary of Changes Made

1. **Git Status Review**: Confirmed that the changes are from a Next.js build replacing old build artifacts with new ones. The project successfully migrated from Create React App to Next.js.

2. **Build Verification**: Ran `npm run build` - completed successfully with no errors. The app is configured for static export suitable for GitHub Pages deployment.

3. **Local Testing**: Started the production server with `npm run start` and verified it's working correctly on http://localhost:3000.

4. **Performance Optimizations**: 
   - Added React.memo to WebGLStadiumVisualization component
   - Added React.memo to ResponsiveStadiumGuide component

5. **Deployment Preparation**: 
   - Staged the performance optimization changes
   - Rebuilt the application with optimizations
   - The app is ready for deployment

### Next Steps for Deployment
- Review all changes with `git diff --staged`
