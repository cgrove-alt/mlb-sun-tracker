# Cache Optimization - 337 KiB Savings Implementation

## Summary
Implemented comprehensive cache optimization to save 337 KiB for returning mobile users by setting efficient cache lifetimes for all static assets.

## Problem Identified
- All static assets served with "None" cache TTL
- 337 KiB of resources re-downloaded on every visit
- Major assets without caching:
  - 700.74c0cb0947b307d8.js - 54 KiB
  - 4bd1b696-cf72ae8a39fa05aa.js - 53 KiB
  - 125.671b34e4131be5b6.js - 48 KiB
  - Fonts, CSS, and other chunks

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced _headers File
- Comprehensive cache rules for all asset types
- Specific rules for high-value chunks
- 1-year cache for immutable assets
- Pattern matching for Next.js static files

### 2. Service Worker Cache Enforcement
- Intercepts all static asset requests
- Adds Cache-Control headers to responses
- Implements aggressive caching strategy
- Works even when hosting doesn't support headers

### 3. Build Process Enhancement
- Added postbuild script for cache headers
- Injects cache control meta tags into HTML
- Service worker communication for cache management

### 4. Multi-Platform Support
- GitHub Pages: Service worker solution
- Netlify/Vercel: _headers file
- Any static host: SW fallback

## Implementation Details

### Service Worker Cache Logic
```javascript
// All static assets get 1-year cache
if (isStaticAsset) {
  response.headers.set('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=31536000, immutable');
}
```

### Cache Patterns
- `/_next/static/*` - 1 year, immutable
- `*.js, *.css` - 1 year, immutable
- `*.woff2` fonts - 1 year, immutable
- Images - 1 year, immutable
- HTML - 1 hour with stale-while-revalidate

## Expected Savings

### First Visit
- Normal download: 337 KiB

### Return Visits (with caching)
- Downloaded: 0 KiB
- Served from cache: 337 KiB
- **Savings: 100% (337 KiB)**

### Monthly Impact (per user)
- Without caching: 10 visits × 337 KiB = 3.37 MB
- With caching: 337 KiB (first visit only)
- **Monthly savings: 3.03 MB per user**

## Verification

After deployment, verify caching with:
1. Chrome DevTools → Network tab
2. Look for "304 Not Modified" or "(from cache)"
3. Check Response Headers for Cache-Control
4. Service Worker tab shows cache storage

## Browser Support
- All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Service Worker fallback for older browsers
- Progressive enhancement approach
