## Understanding Sun Patterns at MLB Stadiums

The sun's position dramatically affects shade coverage at baseball stadiums. A 1:00 PM game offers completely different shade patterns than a 4:00 PM start. Understanding these patterns can help you choose the best game times for comfort.

## Early Afternoon Games (12:00-1:00 PM Start)

### Pros
- Third base side typically gets shade first
- Upper deck overhangs provide maximum coverage
- Sun is high, creating more natural shade

### Cons
- Peak UV exposure time
- Field level seats get minimal shade
- Outfield bleachers are completely exposed

### Best Stadiums for Early Games
1. **Yankee Stadium** - Extensive upper deck coverage
2. **Fenway Park** - Green Monster provides unique shade
3. **Progressive Field** - Well-designed overhangs

## Mid-Afternoon Games (3:00-4:00 PM Start)

### Pros
- Sun begins moving west, creating more shade
- First base side starts getting coverage
- Temperature typically cooler than noon

### Cons
- Sun glare can affect viewing angles
- Shade patterns shift during the game
- Some sections transition from shade to sun

### Ideal Seating Areas
- Sections behind home plate
- Third base side (especially upper levels)
- Club level with overhang protection

## Late Afternoon Games (5:00-7:00 PM Start)

### Pros
- Most shade coverage of any day game
- Cooler temperatures
- Sun sets during later innings

### Cons
- Sun glare in early innings
- Shadows can affect field visibility
- Rush hour traffic considerations

## Seasonal Considerations

### Spring (April-May)
**Best Times**: 3:00-4:00 PM starts
- Lower sun angle creates more shade
- Cooler temperatures reduce heat stress
- Third base side ideal for afternoon games

### Summer (June-August)
**Best Times**: 5:00-7:00 PM starts
- Avoid peak heat hours
- Maximum shade in later innings
- Consider night games when possible

### Fall (September-October)
**Best Times**: 1:00-2:00 PM starts
- Pleasant temperatures
- Lower sun angle throughout
- Earlier sunset times

## Stadium-Specific Recommendations

### East Coast Stadiums
**Optimal Times**: 4:00-7:00 PM
- Sun sets behind most stadiums
- Later starts avoid peak heat
- Examples: Yankee Stadium, Fenway Park, Citizens Bank Park

### West Coast Stadiums
**Optimal Times**: 1:00-4:00 PM
- Marine layer provides natural cooling
- Sun angle favors afternoon games
- Examples: Oracle Park, Petco Park, Dodger Stadium

### Midwest Stadiums
**Optimal Times**: 3:00-5:00 PM
- Balance between heat and shade
- Variable weather considerations
- Examples: Wrigley Field, Busch Stadium, Target Field

## Tips for Different Start Times

### 1:00 PM Games

- Consider upper deck seats
- Hydrate extensively before the game

### 4:00 PM Games
- Check sunset time for your date
- First base side gets late-game shade
- Bring sunglasses for sun glare
- Dress in layers for temperature changes

### 7:00 PM Games
- Still considered "day games" in summer
- Sun sets during middle innings
- West-facing seats get direct sun early
- Best overall comfort level

## Special Considerations

### Getaway Day Games
Many Thursday afternoon games start at 12:35 PM
- Maximum sun exposure
- Prioritize covered seating
- Consider weeknight games instead

### Weekend Day Games
Saturday/Sunday games typically 1:00-4:00 PM
- Most crowded shade sections
- Arrive early for best spots
- Premium shaded seats sell out first

### Holiday Games
July 4th, Memorial Day, Labor Day often day games
- Peak attendance and sun exposure
- Book shaded seats well in advance

- Bring portable shade

### Afternoon Games (1:00 PM - 3:30 PM)
- Third base/left field optimal

- Club level worth the cost

### Evening Games (4:00 PM - 7:00 PM)
- First base side for late shade
- Behind home plate safest bet
- Lower levels become viable

## Conclusion

Choosing the right game time can make the difference between an enjoyable day at the ballpark and a miserable sun-soaked experience. While 7:00 PM starts offer the best overall comfort, earlier games can be manageable with proper planning and seat selection.

Remember that shade patterns vary by stadium, season, and specific game date. Always use The Shadium's real-time tracker to verify shade coverage for your specific game before purchasing tickets.

The best time for a day game ultimately depends on your priorities: maximum shade (late afternoon), cooler temperatures (evening), or traditional baseball atmosphere (early afternoon). Plan accordingly and enjoy the game!
