## The Fenway Factor: Unique Shade at America's Oldest Ballpark

Fenway Park, built in 1912, wasn't designed with modern comfort in mind. However, its quirky dimensions and iconic features create unexpected shade opportunities that savvy fans can exploit. The key is understanding how the Green Monster, the unusual angles, and the compact design work together.

## Green Monster Shade Patterns

### The Monster's Shadow
The 37-foot Green Monster casts a significant shadow that moves throughout the game:

**1:00 PM Games**
- Sections 32-33 get early shade
- Left field grandstand benefits most
- Shadow extends to third base by 3:00 PM

**4:00 PM Games**
- Monster shadow reaches infield
- Sections 10-14 get coverage
- Best shade value in the park

**7:00 PM Games**
- Limited Monster shadow benefit
- Focus on structural overhangs instead

### Monster Seats Themselves
Sitting on the Green Monster:
- No overhead coverage
- Full sun exposure all game
- Spectacular views but zero shade
- Not recommended for day games

## Best Shaded Sections at Fenway

### Pavilion Level (Covered Sections)
**Sections 1-7 (Pavilion Boxes)**
- Protected by roof overhang

**Sections 8-33 (Back Rows)**

- Excellent shade for day games
- More affordable than Pavilion
- Classic Fenway experience

The right field foul pole area creates interesting shadows:

- Often overlooked by fans

### The Triangle
The center field triangle affects shade:
- Creates shadows in Sections 35-36

Unlike modern stadiums, Fenway's concourses offer little shade relief:
