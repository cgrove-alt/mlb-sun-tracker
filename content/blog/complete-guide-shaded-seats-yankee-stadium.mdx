## Why Shade Matters at Yankee Stadium

Yankee Stadium in the Bronx can get incredibly hot during summer day games. With temperatures often reaching into the 90s and the sun beating down relentlessly, finding a shaded seat can be the difference between an enjoyable game and a miserable experience.

The current Yankee Stadium, opened in 2009, was designed with some shade considerations, but not all seats are created equal when it comes to sun protection. This guide will help you find the perfect shaded seat for any day game.

## Best Shaded Sections by Time of Day

### Early Afternoon Games (1:00 PM Start)

For 1:00 PM starts, the sun is high and slightly to the south, making these sections your best bet:

- **Sections 305-315** (Upper deck, third base side): These sections benefit from the upper deck overhang and are typically in shade by the 3rd inning
- **Sections 420B-428** (Grandstand level): Protected by the upper deck above
- **Sections 214A-220B** (Main level, behind home plate): Partial shade from the upper levels

### Late Afternoon Games (4:00 PM Start)

As the sun moves west, different sections become preferable:

- **Sections 305-320** (Upper deck, third base to left field): Maximum shade coverage
- **Sections 103-110** (Field level, third base side): Start getting shade around the 5th inning
- **Sections 205-210** (Main level, third base side): Good shade coverage after the first few innings

## Season-by-Season Shade Guide

### Spring (April-May)
During spring games, the sun angle is lower, creating more natural shade:
- First base side sections get morning shade
- Third base side ideal for afternoon games
- Upper deck provides consistent coverage

### Summer (June-August)
Peak sun intensity requires strategic seating:
- Prioritize upper deck sections with overhangs
- Avoid outfield bleachers unless it's a late game
- Consider sections 300-330 for maximum protection

### Fall (September-October)
Lower sun angles create different shade patterns:
- Field level sections become more viable
- Earlier shade coverage on third base side
- Right field sections get late-game shade

## Premium Shaded Seating Options

### Legends Suite (Sections 11-29)
While expensive, these seats offer:
- Partial shade from the second deck overhang
- Access to climate-controlled indoor areas
- Ability to escape the sun between innings

### Jim Beam Suite (Sections 320-328)
Great value for shade seekers:
- Covered by the upper deck
- All-inclusive food and beverage
- Consistently shaded throughout the game

### Field Level Sections 103-114
Best field-level shade options:
- Protected by overhang after 3rd inning (day games)
- Close to concessions and restrooms
- Great view of the field

## Sections to Avoid During Day Games

Some sections receive direct sun throughout most day games:

- **Bleacher Sections 201-239**: No overhead coverage, full sun exposure
- **Sections 305-310 (Right field)**: Sun-drenched for most of the game
- **Sections 132-136**: Field level with minimal shade coverage
