## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Accurate Sun Tracking
- **Real orientations**: Uses actual home plate to center field bearings
- **Precise calculations**: Morning, afternoon, and evening sun exposure
- **Climate factors**: Accounts for altitude, humidity, and geographic location

### 2. Stadium-Specific Layouts
- **Capacity-based sections**: More sections for larger stadiums
- **Level-appropriate amenities**: AAA gets premium features, A gets family-friendly options
- **Historic accuracy**: Older stadiums have period-appropriate features

### 3. Unique Stadium Features

#### High-Capacity Stadiums (>10,000)
- Executive suites and club levels
- Multiple concourse levels
- Premium dining options

#### Mid-Capacity Stadiums (5,000-10,000)
- Party decks and group areas
- Outfield berms and lawn seating
- Regional specialty features

#### Intimate Stadiums (<5,000)
- Family picnic areas
- Community gathering spaces
- Unique architectural elements

### 4. Geographic and Climate Adjustments

#### Hot Climate States (AZ, TX, FL, NV, CA)
- **Enhanced shade structures** on premium sections
- **Covered concourses** and overhangs
- **Heat-resistant amenities**

#### Cold Climate States (WA, OR, NY, MA, MI, WI, MN)
- **Wind protection** on upper levels
- **Heated club areas**
- **Weather-resistant features**

#### Elevation Adjustments
- **High altitude stadiums** (>4,000 ft): Enhanced UV warnings
- **Coastal stadiums**: Marine layer and humidity considerations
- **Desert locations**: Intense sun and low humidity factors

## Usage Examples

### Basic Stadium Lookup
```typescript
import { getCompleteStadiumData } from './completeStadiumIntegration';

// Get complete data for a specific stadium
const stadium = getCompleteStadiumData('worcester-red-sox');
console.log(stadium?.stadium.name); // "Polar Park"
console.log(stadium?.layout.sections.length); // Number of sections
console.log(stadium?.enhancementData.qualityScore); // Quality score 0-100
```

### Search and Filter
```typescript
import { searchStadiums, getStadiumsByLevel } from './completeStadiumIntegration';

// Get all AAA stadiums
const aaaStadiums = getStadiumsByLevel('AAA');

// Search by multiple criteria
const largeNewStadiums = searchStadiums({
  capacityRange: { min: 8000, max: 15000 },
  yearRange: { min: 2000, max: 2025 },
  level: 'AAA'
});

// Find Yankees affiliates
const yankeesStadiums = searchStadiums({
  parentOrg: 'New York Yankees'
});
```

### Sun Exposure Analysis
```typescript
import { getSunExposureReport } from './completeStadiumIntegration';

// Get sun exposure data for all stadiums
const sunReport = getSunExposureReport();

// Find stadiums with most afternoon sun exposure
const sunnyStadiums = sunReport
  .filter(r => r.sunExposureScore > 75)
  .sort((a, b) => b.sunExposureScore - a.sunExposureScore);
```

### Quality and Coverage Reports
```typescript
import { getImplementationQualityReport, validateCompleteImplementation } from './stadiumSystemDemo';

// Get quality metrics
const qualityReport = getImplementationQualityReport();
console.log(`Average quality: ${qualityReport.averageQualityScore}/100`);

// Validate complete implementation
const validation = validateCompleteImplementation();
console.log(`Coverage: ${validation.implementedStadiums}/${validation.totalStadiums} stadiums`);
```
