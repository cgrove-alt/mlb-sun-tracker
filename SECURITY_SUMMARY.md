# Security Implementation Summary

## Mobile Site Security Enhancements

I've successfully ensured that the mobile site has all the same protections as the desktop site. Here's what was implemented:

### 1. **Security Headers** (via middleware.ts)
- Applied comprehensive security headers to ALL routes (mobile and desktop)
- Includes CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.
- Headers prevent clickjacking, XSS, and other common attacks

### 2. **Input Validation** (utils/validation.ts)
- Created validation functions for:
  - Stadium IDs (only lowercase letters and hyphens)
  - Dates (YYYY-MM-DD format)
  - Coordinates (latitude/longitude ranges)
  - Filter criteria
  - XSS prevention via input sanitization

### 3. **API Security**
- Added validation to MLB API service:
  - Date format validation
  - Team ID range checking
  - URL sanitization before requests
- Added validation to Weather API service:
  - Coordinate range validation
  - URL sanitization
- Whitelist of allowed API hosts

### 4. **Rate Limiting**
- Implemented client-side rate limiting:
  - Game loading: 5 requests/minute
  - Weather loading: 10 requests/minute
- Prevents API abuse and reduces server load

### 5. **Mobile App Updates**
- Added HelmetProvider wrapper (same as desktop)
- Integrated SEOHelmet component
- Added input validation for stadium selection
- Added filter criteria validation
- Implemented rate limiting for API calls

### 6. **Additional Security Features**
- No API keys exposed in client code
- HTTPS enforced in production
- Error boundaries for graceful error handling
- No sensitive data in error messages

## Files Modified/Created:
1. `/middleware.ts` - Security headers for all routes
2. `/src/utils/validation.ts` - Input validation and sanitization
3. `/src/utils/apiRateLimit.ts` - API rate limiting utilities
4. `/src/services/mlbApi.ts` - Added validation
5. `/src/services/weatherApi.ts` - Added validation
6. `/src/MobileApp.tsx` - Added security features
7. `/src/App.tsx` - Fixed mobile wrapper

## Result:
Both mobile and desktop versions now have comprehensive security protections including:
- Protection against XSS, clickjacking, and injection attacks
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Secure API communication
- Proper error handling

The application successfully builds and all security measures are active.
