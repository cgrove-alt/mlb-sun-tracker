            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <h3>Do shaded seats cost more?</h3>
            <p>
              Not necessarily. Shade depends on time of day and stadium orientation, not ticket pricing. 
              Some affordable upper deck seats offer excellent shade coverage.
            </p>

            <h3>How accurate are shade predictions?</h3>
            <p>
              The Shadium uses precise sun calculations based on stadium coordinates, date, and time. 
              Weather conditions like clouds can provide additional shade beyond our predictions.
            </p>

            <h3>What if my section gets partial shade?</h3>
            <p>
              Partial shade means some rows will be shaded while others won't. Generally, higher row 
              numbers in a section get shade first as the sun moves across the sky.
            </p>
