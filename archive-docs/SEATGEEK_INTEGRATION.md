# SeatGeek Integration

This document describes the SeatGeek API integration for ticket purchasing functionality.

The MLB Stadium Sun Tracker now integrates with SeatGeek to provide real-time ticket pricing and purchasing options, specifically highlighting affordable seats in shaded sections.

## Features

- Displays sections with ‚â§20% sun exposure and tickets under $40
- Shows pricing from lowest to highest
- Direct links to SeatGeek for ticket purchase
- Multilingual support (English, Spanish, Japanese)

### üîó Deep Linking

## API Integration

### SeatGeek API Service (`src/services/seatgeekApi.ts`)

#### Key Methods:
- `getEventsByVenue(venueId, dateTime)` - Find events at specific venue
- `getEventListings(eventId, options)` - Get tickets for an event
- `getAffordableTicketsInSections(eventId, sections, maxPrice)` - Filter tickets by section and price
- `findGameEvent(stadiumId, gameDateTime)` - Match MLB games to SeatGeek events
- `generateTicketUrl(event, options)` - Create purchase links

### Venue Mapping

All 30 MLB stadiums are mapped to their corresponding SeatGeek venue IDs:

```typescript
export const SEATGEEK_VENUE_IDS: Record<string, number> = {
  'angels': 30,        // Angel Stadium
  'astros': 17,        // Minute Maid Park
  'yankees': 237,      // Yankee Stadium
  // ... etc
};
```
