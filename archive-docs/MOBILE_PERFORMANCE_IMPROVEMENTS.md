# Mobile Performance Improvements - Cache Optimization

## Summary
Implemented efficient cache lifetimes and strategies to improve mobile performance, targeting an estimated savings of 337 KiB through better caching.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Service Worker Cache Strategies
- **Images**: Extended cache lifetime to 30 days (was 7 days)
- **Fonts**: Added dedicated font cache with 1-year lifetime
- **Static Assets**: Added dedicated cache for `_next/static` with 1-year lifetime
- **JS/CSS**: Extended cache to 30 days with stale-while-revalidate
- **Stadium Pages**: Added NetworkFirst caching with 3-second timeout

### 2. HTTP Cache Headers Configuration
- Added comprehensive cache headers in Next.js config
- Created `_headers` file for static hosting platforms
- Implemented cache control for:
  - Static assets: 1 year, immutable
  - Images: 1 year, immutable
  - Fonts: 1 year, immutable
  - JS/CSS: 1 year with stale-while-revalidate
  - HTML: 1 hour with stale-while-revalidate
  - Service Worker: No cache (must-revalidate)

### 3. Mobile-Optimized Cache Utilities
Created `mobileCache.ts` with:
- Smart cache eviction for mobile devices (50MB limit)
- Preloading of critical resources
- Cache size monitoring
- Three cache strategies:
  - NetworkFirst (API calls)
  - CacheFirst (static assets)
  - StaleWhileRevalidate (JS/CSS)

## Performance Benefits

### Reduced Network Requests
- Static assets cached for 1 year
- Images and fonts won't re-download
- API responses cached appropriately

### Faster Load Times
- Critical resources preloaded
- Stale-while-revalidate for JS/CSS
- Offline support for cached content

### Mobile Data Savings
- Estimated 337 KiB savings per user
- Reduced API calls with smart caching
- Efficient cache eviction prevents storage bloat

## Implementation Details

### Service Worker Runtime Caching
```javascript
// Extended cache times for better performance
{
  urlPattern: /\.(png|jpg|jpeg|svg|gif|webp|ico)$/i,
  handler: 'CacheFirst',
  options: {
    cacheName: 'image-cache',
    expiration: {
      maxEntries: 100,
      maxAgeSeconds: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 30 days
    },
  },
}
```

### HTTP Headers
```
Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable  // Static assets
Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, stale-while-revalidate=86400  // JS/CSS
```

## Testing
- Build completed successfully
- Service worker properly configured
- Cache headers will be applied on deployment

## Next Steps
1. Deploy changes to production
2. Monitor cache hit rates
3. Adjust cache sizes based on usage patterns
4. Consider implementing WebP images for additional savings
