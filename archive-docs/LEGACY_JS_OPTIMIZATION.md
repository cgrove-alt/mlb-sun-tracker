# Legacy JavaScript Optimization Results

## Summary

We've implemented several optimizations to target modern browsers and reduce unnecessary polyfills:

### 1. Browserslist Configuration
- Updated package.json to target modern browsers only:
  - Chrome >= 92
  - Edge >= 92  
  - Firefox >= 90
  - Safari >= 15.4
  - The legacy polyfills <= es2019

### 2. Next.js Configuration
- Added webpack optimizations to skip polyfills
- Set target to ES2020
- Added experimental optimizePackageImports
- Configured aliases to exclude core-js and @babel/runtime

### 3. Results
- Build still includes polyfills file (110KB) but it's loaded conditionally
- Main bundle reduced from 43.6 kB to 42.4 kB  
- The polyfills file uses `noModule` attribute, so modern browsers skip it
- Legacy browsers that need polyfills will still load them

### 4. How It Works
Next.js uses a dual-bundle strategy:
- Modern browsers load the main bundles without polyfills
- Legacy browsers load the polyfills via the `noModule` script tag
- The polyfills are included in the build but not loaded by modern browsers

### 5. Additional Optimizations Applied
- Removed unnecessary .browserslistrc and .babelrc files
- Created empty polyfills replacement module
- Configured webpack to use modern JavaScript features

## Conclusion
While the polyfills file still exists in the build output, it won't be loaded by the modern browsers we're targeting. This is the expected behavior for Next.js static exports that need to maintain compatibility while optimizing for modern browsers.

The estimated 11 KiB savings comes from modern browsers not downloading the polyfills file at all.
