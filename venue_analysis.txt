## Analysis Plan:

1. **Basic Information Verification**: Check stadium names, locations, and current team names
2. **Capacity Analysis**: Verify capacities are reasonable for each MiLB level
3. **Orientation Validation**: Ensure field orientations are valid (0-360°)
4. **Coordinate Accuracy**: Check GPS coordinates match actual stadium locations
5. **Affiliation Verification**: Confirm MLB affiliate relationships are current
6. **League Level Classification**: Verify proper MiLB level assignments

## Issues to Investigate:

- Capacity variations within same levels
- Orientation angle consistency  
- Recent stadium name changes
- Current MLB affiliations (as of 2024-2025)
- Geographic coordinate accuracy
