first think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to todo.md
the plan should shave a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan
then, begin working on the todo items, marking them complete as you go
please, every step of the way just give me a high level explaination of what changes you made
make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. we want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. every change should impact as little code as possible. everything is about simplicity
Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any relevant information
DO NOT BE LAZY. NEVER BE LAZY. IF THERE IS A BUG FIND THE ROOT CAUSE AND FIX IT. NO TEMPORARY FIXES. YOU ARE A SENIOR DEVELOPER. NEVER BE LAZY
